The Anonymous Polling System allows users to participate in surveys anonymously without logging in. However, each user is restricted to submitting a survey only once to ensure the integrity of the results. Admins have access to a sign-in and sign-up page, providing them with full control to create, delete, stop, and view survey results. This feature ensures that the admin can manage the surveys effectively while keeping user participation simple and secure.
